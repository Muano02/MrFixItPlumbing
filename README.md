## Project Overview
Mr FixIT Plumbing is a family-run plumbing business established in 2016, serving Midrand and the surrounding suburbs. The company's mission is to deliver reliable, high-quality plumbing services to local households and businesses, while the long-term vision is to become Midrand's most trusted plumbing partner with a strong digital presence.  

The intended audience comprises local homeowners, property managers, and small businesses (primarily ages 25–55) who need a trustworthy, professional plumber. Prior to this project the business lacked a website, limiting its visibility and the ability to generate online leads. The new website addresses these gaps by:

- Establishing an online presence that highlights services, testimonials, and contact points.
- Improving local SEO with structured content, metadata, and relevant keywords.
- Offering clear calls-to-action so prospective clients can request quotes or reach the team quickly.
- Showcasing brand identity through consistent colors, typography, imagery, and tone.
